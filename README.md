Making a "game engine" using PyGame, all in one file. The user can import modules and use them to make a game quickly, without writing a lot of code.

I have included an example file that showcases the capabilities of this game engine, and will be updated to showcase new features that will be added.

All files and folders other than **Engine** is just to showcase the game engine. You only need **Engine** to make great games :)

Look at the example projects to see what the engine is capable of, and how to use it.

I have not used AI, except for Mistral for tips on how to make a good game engine.
